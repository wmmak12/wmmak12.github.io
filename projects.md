### [Guide to investing hotels in Bangkok (Launch Project)](https://github.com/wmmak12/capstone_project) 
Based on a recent article from Lonely Planet in 2018, Bangkok is listed as one of the top 10 most-visted cities in the world ([source](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2018/09/25/most-visited-cities-travel/)). As such, for my General Assembly's capstone project, I wanted to provide a guide for prospective businesses seeking to invest hotels in Bangkok. 

Using a combination of different machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques, my project aims to perform analysis to identify guestâ€™s most important likes and dislikes on rating whether if a hotel is value for money. This enables investors to focus on key areas of investments in order to maximise their returns.
