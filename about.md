Welcome to my humble website. My name is Ethan Mak, and I am an insurance professional with 5 years of experience in risk management and underwriting. 

The motivation to learn a complete new skillsets in Data Science is primarily because I have always been intrigued by consumer behavior. This was also the reason why I took double degree in Business Administration and Psychology in University. Psychology research paper has always been heavily emphasised on statistic.
